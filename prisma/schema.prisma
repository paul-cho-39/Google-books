// Relationships:
// User and Book:

// A many-to-many relationship exists between users and books.
// This relationship is established through the intermediary UserBook model.
// User and Rating:

// A one-to-one relationship exists between a user-book pairing and a rating. A user can rate a specific book only once.
// User and Log:

// A one-to-many relationship exists between a user-book pairing and logs. A user can have multiple log entries for a single book.
// User and Bookmark:

// A one-to-many relationship exists between a user and bookmarks. A user can have multiple bookmarks.
// User and Account:

// A one-to-many relationship exists between a user and accounts. A user can be associated with multiple third-party accounts.
